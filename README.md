Module 4 Web APIs Code Quiz Challenge!

Building a timed coding quiz with multiple choice questions.

## Introduction
For this assignment, we were required to build a timed coding quiz with multiple choice questions. The Timed Code Quiz features HTML and CSS pages powered by JavaScript code.

## Criteria
To try and meet the Accepted Criteria of this assignment, I created a timed multiple choice quiz using a JavaScript file that featured the following:

When clicking the "Start Quiz" button, a 60 second timer begins and the user has that amount of time to answer 5 multiple choice questions.

The user is then presented with the first of those 5 multiple choice questions.

When the user answers a question, they are then presented with the next question until all 5 questions have been answered.

When the user answers a question incorrectly, 10 seconds are deducted from the clock/timer.

When all the questions have been answered or the timer reaches 0 seconds (whichever comes first), then the game is over.

The game finishes with a page that features either the word "Correct!" (if Question 5 was answered correctly) or the word "Wrong!" (if Question 5 was answered incorrectly or if time expired).

## References
To complete this assignment I studied the following activities from the Module 4-JavaScript Class File as references:

"07-Ins_Create-Append" "09-Ins_Timers-Intervals" "11-Ins_Event-Listener" "21-Ins_Local-Storage" 

After this, I searched the internet for further information for the timed coding quiz and came across the following websites:

"https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/create-a-quiz-app-with-timer-using-html-css-and-javascript/"
"https://github.com/pbullock08/javascript-fundamentals-quiz"

The process of coding for me involved using code from the activities and websites and commenting out every section of code in my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to see what each specific block of code accomplished.  I then attempted to build the quiz by first creating the HTML and CSS files FOLLOWED by the JavaScript file to try and tie everything together.

This led to a lot of experimentation in order to see what I felt was needed to ultimately complete as much of the Acceptance Criteria of the assignment as I could.

The experimentation was necessary since it should be pointed out that while the code given on the above referenced websites was very helpful, the code given DOES NOT completely accomplish everything that was asked for in the Acceptance Criteria.

I was not able to properly complete all that was asked for in the Acceptance Criteria.  I was unable to understand the coding from the previously mentioned websites for when the quiz is over and the user needs to save their initials and score, thus I was unable to generate that code.  You will not find that part of the Acceptance Criteria in my assignment.

## Screenshots
Here are the screenshots from when I started the quiz by clicking the "Start Quiz" button:
